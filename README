gr_car_counter
==============

A GNU Radio flowgraph that uses a microphone on a USB sound card to
count cars driving past.  It's meant to run on a Raspberry Pi 2, but
will probably work on just about anything that can run GNU Radio
reasonably well.  In particular, you'll want to make sure the FFTW
implementation for your platform is decent, as this does a fair number
of small FFTs while it runs.

For more on the theory of operation, see the IPython/Jupyter notebook
in the web directory, web/Explanation.html.
