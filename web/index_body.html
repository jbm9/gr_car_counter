<h1>Counting Cars with Raspberry Pi and GNU Radio</h1>

<p>I recently found myself needing to count the cars going past my
house.  I wanted to do this 24/7 for a few weeks, so I couldn't
exactly do it by hand.  Also, it's always more fun to do write overly
complicated programs to do things for you.  There were a few candidate
solutions, but the one that wound up winning was a small GNU Radio
script that implemented a (sort of) simple algorithm to count cars
based on the white noise they made as they went past.</p>

<p>To start with, you probably want to read <a
href="Explanation.html">the explanation of the algorithm</a>,which
includes a bit of its theory of operation.  Once you have a rough
handle on that, if you want to try and use it yourself, I've included
a copy of the script I use to gather the data in the git repo for this
page.  See below for instructions on getting it.  You'll need a
raspberry pi with a USB sound card an a little microphone that gets a
relatively quiet "view" of the street.  From there, you'll want to do
'apt-get install gnuradio' on the RPi's OS, and hope that it gets
everything you need to run the script in a screen.</p>

<p>This is all provided as-is, with no support.  I wrote this as a
quick one-off hack to solve a specific problem, and am sharing it
mostly because a few people asked how I was doing it.  I hope it's
instructive and inspirational for others considering similar things,
but I don't know if it will work for anyone else. It's not clear if
the techniques used here are generally applicable, or if they only
work on my relatively quiet city street.</p>

<p>Thanks, and happy hacking!</p>
